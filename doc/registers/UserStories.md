It will be possible to define ad-hoc lessons independently of the plan.

- Teacher selects a lecture and starts the plan definition
- Systems ask for basic plan parameters: duration, etc
- System suggest different plan wizards: Periodical, weekly, custom.

- The teacher accepts the plan or modifies it as long as it is required.

A plan is just used to suggest and inform, so on every time the plan can be changed, event for lessons on the pass.
